# Hi there! 👋

I am a civil engineer driven by curiosity and enthusiasm for learning new things. I am currently exploring the possibilities of web development with a focus on back-end development. As an experienced certified road/highway design engineer, I am trying to implement the skills and experience I have gained into an entirely new field. I strive to implement good practices and keep things simple when writing code.
